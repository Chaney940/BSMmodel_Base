## Homework Set 2 [Due by 9/30 Sat 11 PM, Group]:

Based on the base code I provide, implement your own classes for Black-Scholes-Merton and Normal model. The methods should include

* vanilla option (call/put) price
* delta
* vega

Complete the test codes for the classes ([BSM](TestCode_BSM.ipynb) and [Normal](TestCode_Normal.ipynb)) and make sure that they run without errors.

For BSM model, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) is the best resources. (See also [Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_model) model page).

For Normal model, you may refer to [this note](http://janroman.dhis.org/finance/Swaptions/normal%20swaptions.pdf) by Kazuhiro Iwasawa.
